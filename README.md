# Sketch Share As Is!

This [SketchApp](https://sketchapp.com/) plugin allows to quickly copy selected or all artboards on the page to clipboard as a raster image the way artboards look in Sketch canvas and paste the resulting image whenever you want (Slack, Skype, 3rd party sharing services, etc). A perfect tool for sharing work in progress with your teammates!

2. Un-zip downloaded archive and double-click `share-as-is.sketchplugin` file to install.
